# Neural network experimentation

- Tensorflow wrapper for fast implementation of different architectures when it comes only to fully connected networks

- R implementation of a fully connected neural network: "manual" computation of back propagation & parameters updating
   (Inspired by Andrew Ng Machine Learning mooc on coursera) 
   (Highly inefficient => replace all for-loops by matrix multiplication)
